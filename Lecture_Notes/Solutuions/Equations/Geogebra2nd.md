To find the equation of the plane passing through the points A(1, 2, 3), B(3, 4, 5), and C(2, 1, 4):

1. Find the vectors:
   AB = (2, 2, 2),  AC = (1, -1, 1)

2. Compute the normal vector n:
   n = AB x AC = (4, 0, -4)

3. The equation of the plane is:
   4(x - 1) + 0(y - 2) - 4(z - 3) = 0

   Simplifying:
   x - z = -2

Thus, the equation of the plane is:
x - z = -2

* The plane passes through point $A(1, 2, 3)$ and is parallel to the plane $2x + 3y + 4z = 5$. Find the equation of the plane.

To find the equation of the plane passing through point A(1, 2, 3) and parallel to the plane 2x + 3y + 4z = 5:

1. The normal vector of the given plane is the same as the normal vector of the new plane because they are parallel.  
   Normal vector of the given plane = (2, 3, 4).

2. The equation of the new plane is in the form:  
   2(x - 1) + 3(y - 2) + 4(z - 3) = 0

3. Simplifying:
   2x - 2 + 3y - 6 + 4z - 12 = 0

   2x + 3y + 4z - 20 = 0

Thus, the equation of the plane is:
2x + 3y + 4z = 20
